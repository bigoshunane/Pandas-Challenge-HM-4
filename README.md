# School District Data Analysis

The aim of this project is to utilize python library pandas on Jupyter notebook and develop solution to help school board and mayor of local district make strategic decisions regarding their future budget and priorities. Given dataset of studentsâ€™ math and reading scores and other information such as size, budget, types et.al of schools they attend.

The City School dataset are found in repository with folder named resources and developed computing solution by pandas on juypter is found in PyCityschools folder.

## Final report includes the following:

. District Summary

. School Summary

. Top five performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

. Bottom five performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

. Scores by grade (9th to 12th)

      . Math scores

## Analysis
From computed values and generated tables of given dataset of the city school the following conclusions have been drawn:

The lesser budget the school spending per student the better performance scored by the students in both reading and math with higher percentage of overall passing and vice versa. 

The school size of 1000 to 2000 students have shown better performance in their students grade scores and percentage of overall passing while school size of 2000 to 5000 performed fairly satisfacory but requires more attention for improvement.

Students in charter schools showed higher performance in both scoring grades and percentage of overall passing while those in distric school performed moderate and therefore requires more attention in helping them improve thier performances.
